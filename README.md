# Logsday (rs)

A humble recreation of the famous Logsday website. The original website was abandoned by its creator and is no longer developed. That's why this project aims to not be abandoned and be in development.

You can upload a log once a day. You can see other people's logs. You can invite your friends to post their logs. You can even like other people's logs. Furthermore, you can look at the `TODO` list down below and contribute some of your very own bad code!

## Structure

- To run the server, `cargo run` or `cargo run --release`
  - It should be available on `http://localhost:3000/`
- `Askama` templates (`#[template(path = "index.html")]`) live in `./templates` directory
  - Note that `Askama` templates are not *actually* html files. They're.. templates. With `{{ ... }}` being replaced with stuff before being sent to the client.
- The database is `./sqlite.db`. Needs to be created manually. You will also have to create all tables manually (listed in `SQLite Tables` section).
- You have to have `nice` and `ffmpeg` cmd utilities installed.

## Tech Stack

- Server Side:
  - `SQLite`
  - `FFmpeg`
- Web:
  - `HTMX`
  - `marked.js` live markdown preview
  - `highlight.js` highlighting code blocks
- Rust Crates:
  - `axum` for web server basics
  - `askama` for template rendering
  - `argon2` for password hashing
  - `pulldown-cmark` for markdown to html rendering
  - `sqlx` for interacting with sqlite db
  - `sqlparser` for checking whether two table schemas are identical
  - `infer` for scanning magic bytes of files
  - `image` for converting image formats
  - `webp-animation` for specifically converting gif to webp (wrapper around `libwebp`)
  - `scraper` for looking through html files for linked/embedded files
  - `tokio_cron_scheduler` for cron jobs from Rust, for now
  - `tower_sessions` for easy sessions
  - `axum_typed_multipart` for convenience, for now
  - `tower_governor` for traffic control; currently unused

## Other

- Unix epoch starts on `Thu, Jan 1, 1970`. For an 8-day week, Unix epoch starts on `Mon, Jan 1, 1970`. In code, all weekdays are 0-indexed (Mon = 0, Tue = 1, etc).
- You will not be able to private a project/log. You will be able to unlist it, but not private.
- A bunch of research for this project was done with Gemini.

## Markdown rendering rules

- CommonMark spec
  - Server side uses `pulldown_cmark` with the following options enabled
- Additional options
  - ~strikethrough~
- Additional features
  - `![](name.ext)` represents a multimedia embed, depending on `.ext`. For supported extensions, refer to `filestuff::media_type`

## Environment Variables

- The current system is set up to use a gmail account to send out emails to users when it's their logsday.
  - `export GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD={your_app_password}`
  - The app password can be gotten by going to `https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords`, as long as 2 factor authentication for the account is enabled.
  - And if you're running it yourself, change the email address in `email.rs` - `pub const GMAIL_ADDRESS: &str = "youraddress@gmail.com";`
